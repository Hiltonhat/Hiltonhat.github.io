    <h1>Howdy!</h1>
    <p>My name is Seth (Dani) Katenkamp, and I'm currently a PhD student in Linguistics at <a href="https://ling.yale.edu/people/dani-katenkamp">Yale</a>! I'm originally from Central Florida, but now mainly alternate between New Haven and Atlanta. My main research focus is documenting the history of languages of the Southeastern US, with a particular focus on Choctaw, and I currently manage this website. There are materials for various Indigenous languages on here, and I'd like to state that I don't own any of them, and that they belong to the speech communities that produced them and their descendents. Anyone who has concerns about how these materials are presented (or that they are presented here at all) should definitely let me know!</p>
    <p>You can contact me at seth[dot]katenkamp[at]yale[dot]edu.</p>
