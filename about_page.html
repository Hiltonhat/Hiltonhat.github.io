    <h1>Howdy!</h1>
    <p>My name is Seth (Dani) Katenkamp, and I'm currently a PhD student in Linguistics at <a href="https://ling.yale.edu/people/dani-katenkamp">Yale</a>! I'm originally from Central Florida, but now mainly alternate between New Haven and Atlanta. My main research focus is documenting the history of languages of the Southeastern US, with a particular focus on Choctaw, and I manage this website.</p>
    <p>You can contact me at seth[dot]katenkamp[at]yale[dot]edu.</p>
