    <h1>Howdy!</h1>
    <p>My name is Seth (Dani) Katenkamp (they/them), and I'm currently a PhD student in Linguistics at <a href="https://ling.yale.edu/people/dani-katenkamp">Yale</a>! I'm originally from Central Florida, but now live most of the time in New Haven, CT. My main research focus is documenting the history of languages of the Southeastern US, with a particular focus on Choctaw, though I've also done work on Hitchiti/Mikasuki, Mvskoke/Creek, Timucua, Domari, and Tibetan.</p> 
    <p>There are materials for various Indigenous languages on here, and I'd like to state up front that I don't own any of them, and that they belong to the speech communities that produced them and their descendents. If you have concerns about how these materials are presented (or that they are presented here at all)- please reach out!</p>
    <p>You can contact me at seth[dot]katenkamp[at]yale[dot]edu.</p>
