    <p>Howdy! The tools on this website are web-based, but getting them ready (along with doing some of my other research) involves running other computer code behind the scenes. Some of those scripts aren't very generalizable, but others could be useful to other people, so I've made this page as a place to store them publicly.</p>
    <p>(I know github also exists but figure it couldn't hurt to have stuff in another place too)</p>
    <h2><a href="./flexicon_to_json.py">Flexicon converter</a>:</h2> 
    <p>This script takes the lexicon from a FLEx (Fieldworks Language Explorer) project and converts it into a json object, which you can then interact with in ways that FLEx currently doesn't have tools for. There's a few fields that need to be filled in manually at the top, with instructions on how to do it written in the script. It should work, but if it doesn't, email me! (I'd like to know!)</p>
    <p>It's also not finished yet- it basically only captures the words, their definitions, the part of speech, and a few of the notes fields, but I'll be updating it to include more soon.</p>
