    <h2>Type in the box to get a converted string of text:</h2>
    <p>If you'd like to guide folks who will use your text converter, this might be a place where you can list out the rules you put in the javascript</p>
    <p>So for example, for each rule you could create a pair of paragraph tags ("p" and "/p"), and in between them put something like "4 = for" or "a^" = "aÌ‚"</p>
    <p>You can see some examples of what I'm talking about on my Muskogean keyboard page (add hyperlink)</p>
    <div><input id='originalText'><button id="copyOutputButton">copy!</button></div>

        // my hope is to eventually make a tool on my website where you can just put the conversions you want into a textbox and it'll produce the html file for you, but until then I have this.
        // these javascript comments (the ones with "//" on the left side) will let you know where to put your customizations, so just follow them (and then maybe delete them when you're done!)

        // If you'd like a different key to trigger that action, you can do that by replacing the word "Enter" with the identity of the key you'd like
